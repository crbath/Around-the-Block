This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# How to set up MongoDB

1. Accept invite for project/organization (email sent to you)

2. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/ and log in

3. In the sidebar, click ‚ÄúClusters.‚Äù

4. Find the shared cluster (called around-the-block) and click ‚ÄúConnect.‚Äù

5. Click "Connect your application"

6. Copy the connection string and replace <password> with your DB password
- Should look like: mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/aroundtheblock

7. Open the file: around-the-block-backend/.env

8. Replace the values with your connection details
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://aroundtheblock_user:myPassword@cluster0.mongodb.net/aroundtheblock
JWT_SECRET=your_shared_secret_key
PORT=5000

9. Edit the IP address in client/api/api.js to your machine's local IP address
- const BASE_URL = "http://<your-local-IP>:5000";
- Get local IP on Mac: System Preferences > Network > Select your connection > IP Address
- Get local IP on Windows: Command Prompt > ipconfig > IPv4 Address

10. Open a new terminal and navigate to the around-the-block-backend folder

11. Run node server.js to start the backend server
- You should see "Server running on port 5000" in the terminal
**You can test if the server is running properly by going to http://localhost:5000 to see a welcome message**
**If it says access denied (error 403), make sure that the AirPlay Receiver is turned off in System Preferences > Sharing (Mac)**

12. Open another terminal and navigate to the client folder

13. Run npx expo start to start the Expo development server
